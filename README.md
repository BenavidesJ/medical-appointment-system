# medical-appointment-system
This is a recreation of an university project. The original one was built entirely in php,since I'm not a huge php fan :( this one 
will be entirely built in javascript (BE: restapi using node, express, mysql; FE: not built yet but probably React);

This is my first Node Back End project, so I'm just having fun learning this amazing technology to keep moving forward in my carrer
as a developer. 

### Description
As an small/medium-sized clinic/hospital owner, I'd like to have a system that allows my clients to get appointments. The users don't
  need to be specifically registered to create an appointmet, but if they do, they will get several benefits as: 
  - check the appointment data
  - ask for a re-schedule
  - check their medical profile
  - check their health status
  - manage personal information

In that system, i'd like also the health staff of my clinic, to manage their patients information, manage appointments and build medical
records.
